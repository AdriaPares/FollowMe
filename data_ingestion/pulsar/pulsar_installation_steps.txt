# We need at least 3 small instances with ZooKeeper and 3 for Pulsar. ZooKeeper instances can be very small,
# we will use t3.small for ZooKeeper and r5.large for Pulsar. At least 50 GB on t3, 50 on r3

# Most instructions will come from here: https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/v2.0.1-incubating/deployment/cluster/
# with comments from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxfTcRPrRDs&feature=youtu.be

# For convenience, Z denotes Zookeeper nodes and P the Pulsar Brokers

# Install Java 8

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre -y

# Download Pulsar and unzip on every node (Z + P)

wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/pulsar/pulsar-2.0.0-rc1-incubating/apache-pulsar-2.0.0-rc1-incubating-bin.tar.gz
tar xvzf apache-pulsar-2.0.0-rc1-incubating-bin.tar.gz
cd apache-pulsar-2.0.0-rc1-incubating

# Add the ZooKeeper server names to conf (Z + P)

server.1=zk1.us-west.example.com:2888:3888
server.2=zk2.us-west.example.com:2888:3888
server.3=zk3.us-west.example.com:2888:3888

# easier to do with echo:

echo server.1=ec2-x-xx-xxx-xxxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:2888:3888 >> ./conf/zookeeper.conf
echo server.2=ec2-x-xx-xxx-xxxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:2888:3888 >> ./conf/zookeeper.conf
echo server.3=ec2-x-xx-xxx-xxxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:2888:3888 >> ./conf/zookeeper.conf

# ZooKeeper ID (Only Z). We need to create a myid file with a unique integer to identify them.
# [[[CHANGE THE NUMBER FOR EACH Z NODE]]]

mkdir -p data/zookeeper
echo 1 > data/zookeeper/myid

mkdir -p data/zookeeper
echo 2 > data/zookeeper/myid

mkdir -p data/zookeeper
echo 3 > data/zookeeper/myid

# Initiate the ZooKeeper. Run this in one of the 3 Z nodes, it should start the whole Z cluster

bin/pulsar-daemon start zookeeper

# This doesn't always work, so do we'll check that it's working. Do this on every Z node:
telnet localhost 2181
stat
