#Add all setups we do here to replicate later with terraform

#Python libraries

pip install python-kafka
pip install cassandra-driver --user
pip install boto3
pip install pyspark

# Spark

We also need to reroute $SPARK_HOME to the pyspark folder. Usually:
SPARK_HOME=/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pyspark/
