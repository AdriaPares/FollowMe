- Back-ups in S3.
- Separate cluster in 3 availability zones to survive failure of one Availability Zone
- Choosing Ec2MultiRegionSnitch for scalability from the beginning?
- Separate volumes containing logs and data
- EBS is not recommended for Cassandra storage if you do more than 100 IOPS (we do about 30k IOPS).

- Improve fault-tolerance for read and write by changing queries (read/write) policy (one, two, quorum, all...)
